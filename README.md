# YouTrack-Overdue-Tag-Workflow
Workflow code to automatically tag tasks that are overdue.
This workflow is an "On Schedule" Event


# Requirements
1. You need to have a tag that exists with the value "OVERDUE" (You can of course change this to whatever you want, but ensure the tag exists and you swap "OVERDUE" with your desired existing tags name)
2. the Due Date Field needs to exist on the linked project(s)
